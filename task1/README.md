## Problem 1
file:[t1_1.c](https://github.com/Ar1su-kun/CMC-LMSU-tasks-3rd-semester/blob/master/task1/t1_2.c)
A program that determines how real numbers are converted to unsigned integers when performing assignment operations and explicit casts.  
Answer:
1) 0 <= x <= n-1: result = trunc(x)
2) x < 0: result = (2**n + trunc(x) % 2**n
3) result = (trunc(x) % 2** n)
